Variables
---------

Experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying). The first two columns are the variables:

subject
activity

'subject' has a value from 1 - 30 representing one of the 30 volunteers described above. 'activity' has one of 6 values described above, representing the activity being performed. 

The remaining 66 columns selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals time.acc-xyz and time.gyro-xyz. These time domain signals (prefix 'time') were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (time.bodyacc-xyz and time.gravityacc-xyz) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (time.bodyaccjerk-xyz and time.bodygyrojerk-xyz). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (time.bodyaccmag, time.gravityaccmag, time.bodyaccjerkmag, time.bodygyromag, time.bodygyrojerkmag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency.bodyacc-xyz, frequency.bodyaccjerk-xyz, frequency.bodygyro-xyz, frequency.bodybodyaccjerkmag, frequency.bodybodygyromag, frequency.bodybodygyrojerkmag. (Note the 'frequency' prefix to indicate frequency domain signals). 

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

'.mean': Mean value
'.std': Standard deviation

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'.xyz' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

End Values
----------

Finally all of the data has been averaged by subject/activity/variable. So the end result contains 180 rows of data (30 participants times 6 activities).
